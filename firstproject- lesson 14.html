<h2> How Hermit Crabs Are Abused </h2>

<p> Pet stores, and even most brands made for hermit crabs are to blame for the most part. Food made for hermit crabs are actually toxic due to the producers looking for the cheapest ingredients and not doing research. Painted shells are often sold and even encouraged, even though they often eat the paint when it chips and die a slow painful death. Glass shells are usually way too heavy, they are only for the enjoyment for the human and really torture for the crab. Pet stores selling them leave out critical information, like how they need glass, closed, lids to due to the fact they breath through humidity, and saying you only need one bowl of water and can use sink water. Also, to get crabs into shells, they literally torture the crab by starving it, then placing a plate of food on the other side of the door. They make this door too small for the crab to get through with its shell, forcing the crab to come out of its shell to get through the door. they then take away the old shell, leaving a different, painted one that is most of the time too small or too big so it looks prettier. Also, stores selling them likley have wire cages, which slowly kills the crabs because they put 30-40 in these cages meant for ten at the most, and they cant breath due to the lack of humidity! They then also cant molt, which they critically need to do, because there is most of the time no substrate. </p>

<h2> How To Care For Them Correctly </h2>

<p> Hermit crabs need a 10 gallon tank, and you need at least two. They are socisl creatures and will grt depressed if alone, for this reason its better to have 3. They need two bowls, one saltwater and one purified fresh water. Saltwater or saltwater mix can be purchased at pet shops, and purified water at most walmarts. As for substrate, a two to one ratio of coconut soil to playground sand is best. Its important not to use sand from the beach or colored sand, as colored sand has chemicals and beach sand can have mites. They need something to climb on, such as fishnet, cholla wood, or other climbing nets at pet stores. Shells are needed for when they gow, no colored shell because paint is toxic and the crabs will eat it if it chips off. If you get shells from the beach, and really i suggest you do this even if store bought, boil in regular water for 2-5 minutes depending on size before putting them in the tank. For food, fresh vegetables and premium tropic fish flakes are suggested, stay away from brand names and citrus fruits. </p>

<h1> Different types of Land Hermit Crabs </h1>

<ol>

<li> Strawberry hermit crab. Decently rare, but easily available online. Although, in some cases, pet stores who don't check can have them mixed up with fancy hermit crabs. In fact, they will sell strawberrys as fancy hermit crabs and not even notice! Usually, a good difference is the vibrant red color and bigger size.
<li> Fancy hermit crab. Available at most pet stores. Decently small, usually a dusty red color.
<li> Blueberry hermit crab. Very rare, and illegal to import. Only available with professional breedees online.

<li> Purple pincher hermit crab. Very common, sold at most pet stores if they don't have fancy hermit crabs. Sometimes, they can get mixed up with fancy hermit crabs, but most of the time they aren't confused due to the bright, purple, claws purple pinchers have.

<h2> More On Hermit Crab Care </h2>
<p> Hermit crabs are great pets, and can live 5+ years if taken care of correctly. Too often, kids see hermit crabs at beach stores and want one as a souvenir due too its pretty shell. The parents say "Why not? You dont need much for them." and say yes. They buy a tiny plastic carrier as a "cage" and the "kit" includes a teeny tiny plastic bowl, a poorly painted small decoration that the paint will likely chip from, a small container of hermit crab food, and maybe a tiny bag of colored sand. What all this really is is a containter with incorrect size that doesn't let them breath right, a useless bowl thats likely waaaay too small for the crab, what i call likely poision because the hermit crabs will likely eat the toxic paint that chips off, literally deadly food with preservatives, and toxic sand that sticks to the crab, possibly leading to weakened bodies. Pet stores tell you the incorrect things because they WANT you to think it died for no reason. They want you to think, "Oh well, ill just get another." Hermit crabs really aren't hard to care for, yet they are improperly handled more often than not. All they need is a 10 gallon glass tank with a lid, a 2-1 ratio of coconut soil to playground sand, a few NON-LETHAL DECORATIONS (ex. real half-coconut shells, fake aquariums plants, fishnets, cholla wood), two bowls BIGGER than the crab, saltwater in one, PURIFIED WATER in the other, and food that DOESN'T kill them slowly, such as premium tropical fish flakes. Now, this may sound like a lot and expensive stuff, but really its less than 1/4 of a price of a different pet. If you want to spend less than 75 dollars, (the average cost of all this put together) than you shouldn't be getting a pet because they all cost over 100 dollars with proper care. </p>
